It was founded by Shri. B. V. Ranade an IIT Mumbai graduate in Electrical Engineering. We have been manufacturing Analytical instruments specifically for clinical laboratories from 1989. The foremost of its products include <span style="font-weight:bold">Biochemistry Analyzers ( Kanad Photon), Digital Colorimeters (HANS), Digital Haemoglobinometers (HEMA) &amp; Dry Bath Incubators. </span></p><p>Kanad Vidyut is most widely known by its most famous brand <span style="font-weight:bold">HANS Digital Colorimeters.</span> These instruments stood the test of time for more than 25 years. It still has <span style="font-weight:bold">no equal for its Stability, Repeatability & Precision. </span> In year 2000 the Kanad Vidyut products went through a revolutionary change in Technology with Solid state light sources at its core. This eliminated the use of disposable Filters & halogen lamps. This Technology gave Kanad Vidyut products a future edge as well as maintenance free operation.</p><p>In year 2005 Kanad Vidyut was the First in India to introduce 1st Biochemistry Analyzer. It was not only maintenance free & equipped with future technology, but also built so that it can work in only 250μl (0.250ml) reagent volume (1/4th other machines). This gave the most cost effective solution for the labs. Considering the essential requirements for Rural and smaller parts in India, in 2007 Kanad Vidyut Introduced its Biochemistry Analyzer with smaller footprint which took space of less than 1sq ft</p><p>From 2011 Shri. Aditya. B. Ranade a graduate in Mechanical Engineering (VIT Pune) has joined Kanad Vidyut to boost development & manufacturing. With its research oriented and highly educated research team at its core Kanad Vidyut will always come with well designed & intelligent products that will help people.</p></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-warning"><div class="panel-heading"><div class="panel-title">Mr. B.
